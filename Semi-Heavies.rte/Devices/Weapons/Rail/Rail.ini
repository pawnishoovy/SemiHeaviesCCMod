	Description = A railgun. Accelerates a heavy metal projectile to speeds comparable to a high-caliber bullet whizzing through the air. The difference is that it's a skull-smashing rod of steel flying through the air, not a prick of lead. Requires a new battery for each shot - and high command doesn't have any responsibility for them blowing up due to improper placement.
