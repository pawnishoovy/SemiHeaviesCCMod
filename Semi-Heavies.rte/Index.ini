	Description = This faction was created when the Semi-Heavies split from the official Heavies. They remain on neutral terms with the originals, but adopt a much more sensible arsenal and tactical way of fighting. They only took the more sane gunsmiths with them, and as such their arsenal is much less extravagant.
